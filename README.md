#I Made Wordle
<br>
Welcome to my Wordle-inspired game! ðŸŽ‰ I'm excited to share this simple yet engaging word-guessing experience created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this recreation, I strived for clarity and simplicity, echoing the charm of the original Wordle craze. Interestingly, just like my CSS skills (okay, maybe three lines of code, but who's counting?), your attempts are unlimited! Dive into the fun and challenge your word-guessing prowess by playing it live at: [Your Website Link]. Enjoy the game! ðŸ˜„ #Wordle #WebDev
